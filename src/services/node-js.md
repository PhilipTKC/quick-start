# NodeJS

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

## Download{.separator}

Download the Node.js source code or a pre-built installer for your platform. It's recommended that you use **NVM (Node Version Manager)**

nvm is a version manager for node.js, designed to be installed per-user, and invoked per-shell. nvm works on any POSIX-compliant shell (sh, dash, ksh, zsh, bash), in particular on these platforms: unix, macOS, and windows WSL.
